Adds a visual progress bar below each expense category row showing how much of the budgeted amount has been spent. The bar turns red when a category is overspent, with a distinct overflow segment indicating how far over budget spending has gone. Hovering over the bar shows a tooltip with a detailed breakdown (budgeted, spent, balance, and percentage). Enable via Settings > Experimental Features.
